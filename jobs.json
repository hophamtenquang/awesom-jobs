Since our platform launched in 2014, Oddle is heating up the food delivery space, with over USD16 million worth of orders transacted!</p>\n<p>Unlike marketplaces, Oddle is a cloud-based, e-commerce and orders management solution which caters specifically to the operations of F&amp;B businesses. Our solution is a unified, all-in-one online ordering system \u2028which funnels all orders to designated restaurants.</p>\n<h2>What hard problems we're trying to solve here</h2>\n<p>Our story goes back to 2013 &mdash; we were our products' first users! As restaurateurs ourselves, we understand how hard it was to manage delivery and takeaway orders. \u2028With orders streaming in during peak hours via multiple channels, \u2028it&rsquo;s hard for restaurateurs to keep up.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, marketplace solutions didn't provide for the autonomy and individual marketing needs of each restaurant. New names get lost in the sea of similar food places. It isn&rsquo;t exactly a win-win situation for the bigger players either. All orders are priced on a commission-based scheme, including returning customers!</p>\n<p>Coupled with pressing challenges in the industry, we realised F&amp;B players need technology more than ever to grow their business beyond the 4 walls of a restaurant. Drawing insights from several restaurant owners, we saw a true need for a affordable and more ops-friendly solution.</p>\n<h2>Why it would be awesome to work with us</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with a passionate and driven team</li>\n<li>Cool bosses</li>\n<li>Performance bonus 2 times/year</li>\n<li>Laptop and monitor will be provided</li>\n<li>15 leave days/year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking to immerse yourself right at the heart of the start-up ecosystem? You are looking at the &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo;. Since our inception in 2014 as a B2B company, Oddle has been a leading force in offering the best-in-class enterprise software that transforms how restaurants participate in the online revolution and how people order food online.</p>\n<p>With Oddle, you can be part of creating the most exciting user experiences for people all over the world. We strive to be world-changing and continue blazing the trail - creating the most exhilarating food ordering consumer experiences and improving business decisions through data.</p>\n<h2>Contact</h2>\n<p>Homepage: <a href=\"https://oddle.me\">https://oddle.me</a><br/>\nChelsea (Talent Acquisition) at <a href=\"mailto:chelsea@oddle.me\">chelsea@oddle.me</a> or <a href=\"mailto:joinus@oddle.me\">joinus@oddle.me</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b722f7a4bfbca37bce7557b43e77040f46d0debf/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e74656368696e617369612e636f6d2f646174612f696d616765732f39356538326235333730313838353330383938383862303735313365626332332e6a7067\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-canonical-src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/data/images/95e82b537018853089888b07513ebc23.jpg\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b722f7a4bfbca37bce7557b43e77040f46d0debf/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e74656368696e617369612e636f6d2f646174612f696d616765732f39356538326235333730313838353330383938383862303735313365626332332e6a7067\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f7f38da2c760292479638136bdb94b4723886df6/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e74656368696e617369612e636f6d2f646174612f696d616765732f35653430396132616336306164363261643539393334343532633465336333312e6a7067\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-canonical-src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/data/images/5e409a2ac60ad62ad59934452c4e3c31.jpg\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f7f38da2c760292479638136bdb94b4723886df6/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e74656368696e617369612e636f6d2f646174612f696d616765732f35653430396132616336306164363261643539393334343532633465336333312e6a7067\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e8fdac7783265a109de33a4c7b69a121efb68d5d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e74656368696e617369612e636f6d2f646174612f696d616765732f37353332366366663830363661623338333737643336306630373761306638622e6a7067\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-canonical-src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/data/images/75326cff8066ab38377d360f077a0f8b.jpg\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e8fdac7783265a109de33a4c7b69a121efb68d5d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e74656368696e617369612e636f6d2f646174612f696d616765732f37353332366366663830363661623338333737643336306630373761306638622e6a7067\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    "], "544": ["1PAC Vietnam - Frontend developer - HCM - FT", "May 22, 2017", "https://github.com/awesome-jobs/vietnam/issues/544", "\n      <tbody class=\"d-block\">\n        <tr class=\"d-block\">\n          <td class=\"d-block comment-body markdown-body js-comment-body\">\n              <p><a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16432674/26290061/f3ba3a12-3ece-11e7-8d02-883786d0285e.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"logotype_black\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16432674/26290061/f3ba3a12-3ece-11e7-8d02-883786d0285e.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/></a></p>\n<p>1PAC Vietnam is a new creative production company with its headquarter in Tokyo.
